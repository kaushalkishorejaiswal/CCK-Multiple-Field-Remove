<h2>About CCK Multiple Field Remove</h2>
The CCK Multiple Field Remove Module allows you to add the "Remove" button with CCK Multi-Valued Fields. Yet Now when we add the CCK Multi Valued Fields then, there is no procedure to Remove the Field, If you want to delete the field then you have to Delete the Content first and then after save that field is removed. But this module facilates you to add the Remove button after the Field. It also facilates you to choosing the Multiple Value Field where you want to Add the "Remove" button and where not to. Normally this module will add the "Remove" button only with the Textboxes and the Textareas, because when we create the Select box as a multiple field then it is converted into the Listbox and the Radio Button is converted into the Checkboxes.

This is the drupal full project. You can also download it from drupal site.
