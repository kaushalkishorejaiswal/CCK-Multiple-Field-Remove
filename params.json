Yet Now when we add the CCK Multi Valued Fields then, there is no procedure to Remove the Field, If you want to delete the field then you have to Delete the Content first and then after save that field is removed. But this module facilates you to add the Remove button after the Field. It also facilates you to choosing the Multiple Value Field where you want to Add the \"Remove\" button and where not to. Normally this module will add the \"Remove\" button only with the Textboxes and the Textareas, because when we create the Select box as a multiple field then it is converted into the Listbox and the Radio Button is converted into the Checkboxes.\r\n\r\nThis is the drupal full project. You can also download it from drupal site. \r\n<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/cck_multiple_field_remove\" target=\"_blank\">CCK Multiple Field Remove</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Uses of CCK Multiple Field Remove</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add the Remove Button with Multi Valued CCK Field</li>\r\n<li>Facilates you to add the Remove Button on your selected Fields</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Restrictions</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You cannot add the Remove button with Dropdown, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Drupal Version</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This Module is suitable for drupal version 7.8 or higher because, I have used a function here hook_field_widget_form_alter() and this is available for 7.8 or higher versions.
